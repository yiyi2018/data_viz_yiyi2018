## First Version "Redesign"

I put a Jupyter notebook called [``redesign.ipynb``](redesign.ipynb) in this repository that contains:
- the description of my data source,
- Python code used to clean data set, and
- my findings.

Redesigned visualizations are put in published Tableau worksheets:
- Graph 6 redesign: https://public.tableau.com/views/Graph6_4/GunOwnershipandGunDeath?:embed=y&:display_count=yes
- Graph 8 redesign: https://public.tableau.com/views/Graph8new/OverallTrend?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes
- Graph 14 redesign: https://public.tableau.com/views/Graph14/Sheet2?:embed=y&:display_count=yes&publish=yes

## First Version "Deception"

The deceptive version could be found in a Jupyter notebook called [``Deceptive Version.ipynb``](Deceptive%20Version.ipynb)
