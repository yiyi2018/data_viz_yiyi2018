    "Graph 6 is trying to verify that the higher the gun ownership rate, the higher number of gun homicides in a developed country. However, the countries presented by the graph not only include developed countries, but some developing countries as well. Another problem is that the origin of the graph is not on the left bottom and the y-axis is shifted, making it hard to see whether the gun ownership rate actually has correlation with gun homicides or not. To have a better understanding of the question, the Gun Homicides and Gun Ownership Listed by Country dataset is used for visualization.\n",

There is no clear correlation between stricker gun control law or gun-related deaths. If we categorize the states by the degree of law stringency (either divided by even interval of the grades or even frenquency in each grade), we could see that in general, states with stricker gun-control law seem to have a lower number of gun-related deaths. However, if we break the sum in the second and third graph to show the average number of deaths for each state by law score grade, we can see the trend within each grade seems to be identical. Thus, gun law stringency does not seem to have a huge impact on reducing gun-related deaths. "

The _Gun Ownership and Police Death graph_ shows that states with the highest rate of gun ownership has much higher average number of police death/injuries. However, if we break it by state in _Gun Ownership and Police Death graph_, it seems that the patterns for each level of gun ownership are quite similar. This is especially true if we remove Nevada (since it could be regarded as an outlier owing to the Las Vegas mass shooting in 2017). Doing so will make the trends in each category looks identical and thus could not justify the original statement that polices more likely to be killed in homicides in states with more guns."
